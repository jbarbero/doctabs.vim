DocTabs: a vim plugin for organizing a file into sections

Author: Janos Barbero <jbarbero@cs.washington.edu>

Description:
DocTabs is a plugin that makes one file appear like a collection of
separate files, so you can zoom in on one section at a time, with
user-defined sections that keep their own context, within the same
buffer.

You can navigate and jump between sections seamlessly, and even choose
between file and local actions. Some use cases are: documentation,
source code, HTML, project plans, todo or GTD files, reminder files,
journals, novels, etc. 

You can set manual tags of the form #Section in your document, or use a
pattern to identify section headings. DocTabs updates sections on file
updates, and there is minimal overhead at edit time. This means there
is no lag even with very large documents. Keeping the plugin lightweight
is a first-class priority.

DocTabs was developed using DocTabs.
