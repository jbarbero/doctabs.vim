DocTabs: a vim plugin for organizing a file into sections

Author: Janos Barbero <jbarbero@cs.washington.edu>

DocTabs is a plugin that lets you organize a file into sections which
look like a collection of separate files with their own separate context.
When you are done working on one section, you can jump to another section
with your normal movement commands, or by the provided navigation commands,
and resume the same editing context you had in that section. The tabline
is used to highlight the currently active section.

This allows you to zoom in on one section at a time, but still jump to another
section seamlessly. Some use cases are documentation, source code, HTML,
project plans, todo or GTD files, reminder files, journals, novels, etc. The
DocTabs plugin and documentation were both written using DocTabs.
