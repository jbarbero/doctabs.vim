DocTabs: a vim plugin for organizing a file into sections

Author: Janos Barbero <jbarbero@cs.washington.edu>

DocTabs is like having screen/tmux for a single buffer. Vim already
lets you manage different buffers very efficiently, but within a
buffer you are limited to jumping by searches or tags. With DocTabs,
however, you can organize a large file into sections, which you can
visualize and jump between. Each section keeps its own editing view
so you can jump back to where you were easily. The prefix-style
switching should be familiar to screen/tmux users. The tabline is
used to show all the sections and highlight the currently active
one, hence the plugin's name.

This is useful for a wide range of scenarios: documentation, source
code, HTML, project plans, todo or GTD files, reminder files,
journals, novels, your ~/.vimrc, etc. The DocTabs plugin and
documentation were both written using DocTabs.
